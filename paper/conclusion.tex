\section{Conclusion}

Motivation

Summarization of the paper

Results:
1. Instead of looking at basing the QoE on an entire game. It should be based on a "session"/scene/action of a game.
2. Relating the network QoS to a QoE value is a two-step process. First I need to relate the network QoS parameters to session QoS parameters. Then I can relate the session QoS parameters to a QoE.
3. Also consider User Engagement
